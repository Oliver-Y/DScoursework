## Grade for File Reverse Lab:

Criterion | Points
--- | ---
Automated Testing | 3/3
Input can be passed as a command line argument | 0.5/1
Input can be passed via stdin | 1/1
Good style and documentation | 1.5/2
Thought Questions | 1.75/3

Notes:  
You have a hard coded value of input.txt in your file.  You need to use args to allow the user to pass in a file.  You should only try to create the File object when you know you need one.  Perhaps a comment or two?

You haven't answered the second part of 3.4 (are there other ways to specify the size?).  

For 3.6, you haven't provided an actual implementation.
